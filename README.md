Project Plan

Day 0: Creating the project Repo

Day 1:Structuring the code

Dat 2:Creating tables(since we need to store the task of our users we need to use Database.Let’s keep aside Flask for now and look at the Pythonic way of creating these tables. To handle all the DB related operations we are going to create a separate file)

Day 3: Finding an API for TO-DO-LIST(All we got to do is hit the API endpoint, create some ToDo Items and see it all working in action.)
(NB: The project plan may seem so easy to do so. When you get your hands dirty in the code the plan as mentioned may not work)
